</li>
<li>
<p>Know the Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice and why they are important.<br>
The intend was to enhace professionalism,  and guide interpreters on how to handle an array of situations.<br>
Here are some reasons to take medical ethics seriously: To help resolve disputes between family, patients, physicians, or other parties. Often, the parties involved are operating strictly on emotion, which makes it difficult to come to a logical and fair decision. Ethics adds another dimension to help make decisions.<br>
confidential, accurancy, maintain impartiality, matain the boundaries of professional roles, strives to develop awareness of his/her own culturs, treats all parties respect, adovate, strives to continually further knowledge and skills, ethical manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does the Joint Commission do and why is it important?<br>
The Joint Commission is an independent, nonprofit organization that accredits and certifies healthcare organizations and programs in the US.<br>
Joint Commission certification improves the quality of patient care by reducing variation in clinical processes.<br>
The Joint Commission's standards and emphasis on clinical practice guidelines help organizations establish a consistent approach to care, reducing the risk of error.<br>
To help patiens in order to achieve accreditation. That includes the right to having interpretation services provided as necessary and having appropriate materials available in a aguage that patient can understand.<br>
the effective communication throughtout the informed consent process to ensure parients' rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study common idioms and expressions listed in the book.<br>
p61-63</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name the four modes of interpretation. Which one is most recommended and why? When<br>
would you use each mode of interpretation?<br>
4Modes: consecutive, Stimultaneous, Sight Translation and Summariztion<br>
The Consecutive is recommended, allowing interpreters to relay the infos in the target language. Because it closely resembles a normal conversation between a patient and a provider.<br>
Most of the time using consecutive mode to interpreter accuraly and less errors. Sometimes in the ER switch into stimulataneous to avoid delays informations, sometimes in conferences with interprataion equipent that needs smoother communication this mode can be used.<br>
Sight translation occurs when an interpreter is given a written document and asked to explain the infos to the patient in the target language. Interpreters may be asked by the medial staff to ask the patient the questions and write the answers for the patient.<br>
Summarization even is not recommended, and not appropriate for medical settings. In some cases, interpreters may be asked or may feel inclined , to summarize lengthy messages spoken by the patient or provider to maintain the flow of communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name the four roles of the interpreter. Which role is the most commonly used and why?<br>
Conduit, Clarifier, Cultural Broker, Advocate.<br>
The conduit role is most commonly used, it is the most basic and essential role of an interpreter.<br>
The interpreter listens to the speaker, understands the information and immediately conveys the information as close to the speaker's register as possible. In this case, the interpreter plays the role of a bridge, communicating by sticking to the spoken content and words.<br>
These things influence the accuracy and completeness of a massge, so it is the role that the interpreter will employ the majority of the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the proper positioning for interpreters and why is it important?<br>
The effective way to establish a connection bvetween the patient and provider is for the interpreter to phsically position themselves in a way that encourages <s>direct communication.</s><br>
To stand slighttly behind the patient ot provider, in a 'broken triangle'. This encourges the participants of the conversation to look and speak directly at one another.<br>
When examineing the patient, stand behind to curtain or barrier to protect the patient's privacy.<br>
This maintain as a first person interpretation and giving patient privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does ‚Äúregister‚Äù mean in the context of interpretation?<br>
Regiser is a term that refers to the level at which people speak. There is often a formal register and an informal register. We are bound by our ethics to leave the register unchanged when interpreting.<br>
Try to interpret words in most accurate and proper base on the patients and providers' register.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is ‚Äúteach back?‚Äù<br>
The interpreter would like to teach-back if appers that the patient is not fully understand the content of the message by the provider, uncetain if the information was understood we should always ask the paries to repeat back what was just said, to confirm the infos was relayed.</p>

<p>What is stigma?<br>
Stigma surrdounding mental illness is one of the significant barries that people face when navigating mental health care.<br>
It refers to the mark of disapprobal that is often associated with a quality or a character that is rejected by our society. This causes a person who has a mental illness to be shunned by others, which would make him/her feel ashamed to seek our medical attention. This contributes to the changes in his/her behaciour, thinking, and feelings. Instead of getting the right treatmen t, he/she gets worst due to relucctance to seek out help form health care professionals.</p>
</li>
<li>

Some of the most common counseling skills employed by mental health providers include : attending( sitting close to clients, making eye contact, leaning forward, nodding)<br>
Actively listening ro verbal and nonverbal communication, expressing empathy, paraphrasing or restarting client's words back withour questions, reflecting feelings, using more open-ended than closed-ended questions, etc. Which is accepting and respecting without judgment.</p>

<p>What does the phrase ‚Äúsingle story‚Äù refer to?<br>
Adichie argues that single stories often originate from simple misunderstandings or one's lack of knowledge of others.<br>
A single story is a one sided point of view of something or someone. Single stories have the power to tell false interpretations of the actual story.<br>
The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete.<br>
Single stories can have significant negative impact. They can rob people of their dignity, and emphasize how we are different rather than how we are similar.</p>
