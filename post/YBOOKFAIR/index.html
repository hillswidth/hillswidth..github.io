<p>The MC asked to enact a scene where they prank each other.<br>
MC: …fight over the microphone.<br>
JM: You want to see us fight over the microphone, right? Erm..how should we do this?<br>
TM: How should we do this?<br>
JM: In that case, you need to give your microphone to me.<br>
TM: <em>hands over microphone</em>…<em>tries to get it back</em>…<em>back hugs</em><br>
Fans: <em>died again</em><br>

<p><em>Original Post plz go to Mii2Rhythm</em><br>
MC: if you get mad at eo, how to reconcile?<br>
TM: Just scratch his chin like this Lalaland~<br>
JM: If you do this, nobody gets mad at u<br>
MC: And JM?<br>
JM: We never get mad at eo<br>
MC: but we wanna see<br>
JM: wanna see us getting mad at eo?<br>
MC:just wanna see how you guys to reconcile if anything happened<br>
JM: The way to reconcile? For me, it would be to speak honestly to each other. And then…<br>
TM from turning away* sit and look into each other’s eyes.<br>
TM: … <em>shy</em><br>
MC: <em>shy laugh</em> And that’s all that is needed for you to understand each other.<br>
JMTM: <em>electric shock</em><br>
MC: You guys are so funny.</p>
<h1 id="possessive-example"><a href="%22https://twitter.com/Mii2Rhythm/status/1297498408538615813?s=20%22">Possessive &amp; Example</a></h1>
<p>MC: JMTM have said you both ever feel possessive to eo, we want to know who is more possessive?<br>
TM: Idk but I've heard that JM said 'I have this kinda feeling of possessive'<br>
JM: yes<br>
MC: What situation?<br>
JM: let me tell u first that for me<br>
I'm kinda person who won't do what I don't feel like I wanna do.<br>
The social posting is of the thing that I will do when I wanna do.<br>
Then if I post something, that's mean I really feel it. And there was a day that P'Tommy took vdo exchange clothes with P'Zee<br>
at P'Aof's house. And suddenly, there was a feeling like 'why it's not me' (who do that w/TM) Something like that.<br>
<mark><span style="color:blue"><em>p.s. More contents for this Trans</em><span/></mark><br>
MC: that's mean JM more possessive at TM?<br>
TM: I think equally possessive but I didn't say it out<br>
MC:Right, one person keeps quiet while the other is very explicit in his action..that he is mine.<br>
that ‘this is mine’.<br>
MC: Ahh…This is how it should be! So, did you guys exchange the shirt?<br>
TM: Did you mean P' Zee and I? Yes, we did. I needed to exchange the shirt with him because it is part of our work.<br>
MC: And, does Khun JM understands?<br>
JM: I understand…understand…understand…<br>
MC: Seems like you don’t understand.<br>
JM: I do. I do understand.<br>
MC: OK. So, in conclusion, both of you are very possessive of each other.<br>

JM: Just now you were Nong Zon.<br>
TM: Is this P’ Saifah?<br>
JM: Just now you were Nong Zon. The way you sit.<br>
TM: Is this P'Saifah?</p>
<h1 id="he-is-always-mine">he is always mine.</h1>
<p>When TM asked what do fans think of his cover song, one of fans said she likes the singer then TM ran to JM and told him 'She likes me'</p>
<p>JM: I wasn't hear anything, I didn't care</p>
<p>(Just kidding but OMG-///-)</p>
<h1 id="hashtag"><a href="%22https://twitter.com/Mii2Rhythm/status/1297532933717151745?s=20%22">HashTag</a></h1>
<p>Mii2: u can ask something<br>
Admin: I wanna ask about the hashtag yesterday that JM tweeted. What is that hashtag again? (Just pretend to forgot-,.-)<br>
JM: um.. Tommy, want you to know that I love u.<br>
TM: Is this the right one? Or u just wanna tell me?<br>
<span style="color:blue"> I want to let you know that I love you’ (JM spoke an incorrect hashtag) <span/></p>
<p>TM: Was that me ‘chong-ing’? (Means shipping hard)<br>
JM: Suddenly you ‘chong’. Are you one of the shippers?<br>
JM: But for the tweet that I tweeted just the hashtag from yesterday,  I forgot to type other things with…Worng Clicked.<br>
Fan: What did u has intention to type then?<br>
JM:whta?? I already posted it<br>
JM: <em>nervous laugh</em> You still do not know about that post?<br>
TM took his Phone out of Pocket<br>
JM: U r gonna check now?<br>
TM: (nod)<br>
JM: no need to check, there is nothing<br>
TM: <em>continues to search the phone</em> (said something about someone eating noodles)<br>
Fans: there is something<br>
TM: making me wanna know<br>
JM: (ran away and comeback)<br>
TM: just the hashtag? #.wan you to know that I love Tommy~ &gt;&lt; (and correct it later)<br>
No! (TM read it wrong), “I want you to know that I love you (song name), Tommy’<br>
JM: They are separated. It is ‘I want you to know that I love you’ (name of the song) then ‘Tommy’.<br>
Not ‘want to let you know that I love Tommy’.<br>
JMTM: Suspicious, Suspicious.<br>
JM:Just Kidding x2</p>

<p>JM said, ยัน ยิง เยา ปั๊กกะเป้า ยิ้งฉุบ<br>
'yung ying yao pa ka pao ying chub'<br>
These are the words that precede 'rock-paper-scissors' game.<br>
It cracked TM up so much<br>
he couldn't start singing the song.<br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/BMTMMY/status/1297571215754706944?s=20">continute</a><br>
<em>singing a song called 'still (ยัง 'yang')' by Lipta</em><br>
TM:'Our matters should die, you’ve forgotten them already, but I still (ยัง 'yang')…'<br>
JM: Still (ยัง 'yang') 'what P'?</p>
<p>JM: ยัน ยิง เยา ปั๊กกะเป้า ยิ้งฉุบ 'yung ying yao pa ka pao ying chub'<br>
(The first word sounds like the word 'still' in Thai.<br>
This phrase precedes 'rock-paper-scissors' game.)</p>
<p>TM: <em>laugh</em> <em>tries to continue singing and fail</em><br>
TM: Oh, I sang the wrong verse.<br>
I couldn’t find the right verse after your 'yung ying yao pa ka pao ying chub'<br>
JM: No, we have to sing until the end, properly</p>
<h1 id="i-am-taller-than-you-now"><a href="%22https://twitter.com/Mii2FC/status/1297510764522086400?s=20%22">I am taller than you Now</a></h1>
<p>TM: I want to have this kind of feelings too (being taller).<br>
JM: Alright.<br>
JM: Oh, so, is this how you feel when you talk to me?<br>
TM: Yes. …!!!<br>
TM:  Say it, I got pain on my neck<br>
JM: Where, where, let me try too.<br>
Were we about this far apart (in height)?</p>
<p>TM: Yeh, this is close (i.e. this is about right).<br>
Or like this <em>bend knees</em><br>
JM: No, this is ‘ the real close’ should be  <em>move face towards TM’s face</em><br>
Fans: <em>Screams</em><br>
<em>TM: <em>panic</em> P’ Aof is signaling 'no' x2</em><br>
JM: Cannot, cannot. We need to keep this for the series.<br>
TM: Cannot, cannot.<br>
JM: Today we are here so that everyone can finally meet us in person…<br>

<p>JM: What is that?<br>
TM: Is it ‘imagined couple’ or ‘real couple’?<br>
JM: Is it ‘imagined couple’ or ‘real couple’?<br>
JMTM: <em>wobble</em><br>
JM: <em>arm across TM’s should</em> Yep. It’s like that.<br>
JM: I’m shy. Can’t deal... <em>walks away</em></p>
<p>Fan: shy whhht<br>
Why are you shy?</p>
<p>TM: Let’s take photos better.<br>
JM: OK. How should we take the photo?<br>
TM: I will take it. 1, 2…</p>
<h1 id="love"><a href="%22https://twitter.com/Mii2FC/status/1297520412314615808?s=20%22">LOVE</a></h1>
<p>MC: JM first<br>
JM: The definition of ‘love’ for me…<br>
I feel that love is an abstract and intangible thing.<br>
You cannot see or touch it. It is about the feelings.<br>
For me, love is when you meet someone and the two of you love each other.<br>
The point of loving someone<br>
or<br>
having a แฟน ‘fan’ (boyfriend or girlfriend) …<br>
the good thing about having a ‘fan’ is that,<br>
on the day when you have no one left, you will feel that at least there is one person left in this world who loves you.<br>
Love is probably something like this. I can’t really explain it.<br>
MC: Yes, the basic of everyday life is love.<br>
JM: Yes, yes.<br>
MC: It makes you feel at ease knowing that there is someone for you; it is better than having no one.<br>
JM: That’s right.<br>
MC: What about you, Khun TM?<br>
TM: For me, to love is to understand. If we understand each other, everything will go well.<br>
JM: I understood now.<br>
TM: !!! LOL<br>
Fans: <em>lost it</em><br>
MC: This is an indirect way to tell someone that you love them.<br>
‘I understood now’ means ‘I love you now’, right?<br>
JM: I understood now. I understood.<br>
Just now, what P’ TM said, I understood right away.<br>
TM: Did everyone understand?<br>
MC: Alright, everyone is telling someone that they love them now.<br>
<em>continue</em><br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/Mii2Rhythm/status/1297509219130675201?s=20">Definition of lov</a><br>
MC: What is your definition of love?</p>
<p>TM: I think it is 'understanding' if you understand eo, everything will go well.</p>
<p>JM: I understood  I understood. Just now, what P’ TM said, I understood right away.<br>
TM: Did everyone understand?<br>
MC: Alright, everyone is telling someone that they love them now.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-relieve-stress"><a href="%22https://twitter.com/Mii2FC/status/1297818984423682048?s=20%22">How to Relieve Stress</a></h1>
<p>MC: What are your stress relieve techniques?<br>
Can you advise the fans of some of your techniques?</p>
<p>TM: For me, I like to listen to music. Just a song with good melody and mood can already change our mood.<br>
Also, getting a massage helps as well.<br>
Getting a massage will make you relaxed and comfortable.<br>
JM: Thai massage?<br>
MC: Thai massage.<br>
JM: Actually, I know how to give a massage.<br>
TM: JM, you also like being massaged right?<br>
JM: Yes I do.<br>
Do you know how to give a massage?<br>
TM: I can, I can. Do you want a massage?<br>
<em>reach hand towards JM</em><br>
MC: Tonight, you two can take turn massaging each other.<br>
TM: In fact, I think both of us likes to get a massage.<br>
JM: That’s right.<br>
TM: P’ Aof always take both of us for a massage. We both love it.<br>
MC: So, there are always activities to do and both of you like to get massaged.<br>
Fans, don’t forget this. You can invite them to go for a massage.<br>
MC: Alright, let’s move on to the next question.<br>
If you can enter into a fictional world,<br>
which fictional world would you like to be in and what character do you want to be in that story?</p>
<p>TM: From what I see, I like Harry Potter. I want to have magical power.<br>
JM: Ah, so you like magic.<br>
TM: Yes, yes. It would be fun.<br>
I want to cast a spell on this and that…</p>
<h1 id="exercise">Exercise</h1>
<p>TM: …need to exercise.<br>
JM: Where did you most recently went to do that?<br>
TM:exercise?<br>
JM: Exercise.<br>
TM: I went to play soccer.<br>
JM: Who did you play with?<br>
TM:YouKNow, P’ P’ (plural for P’ i.e. seniors).<br>
JM: Why don’t I know about this?<br>
<em>= =you were playing with ur doggies, and why u don’t check his IG? Fan all know!!!</em></p>
<p>TM: You want me to invite you right?<br>
<em>(Ok, thi Kid was pretending, shit, Fool me 😕)</em></p>
<p>JM: Yeah, you should ask me to come too. I want to play.<br>
(All he wants is a DATE not exercise, maybe Exercise on the BED<br>
)</p>
<p>TM: I want to say that it is good that you weren’t there that day. We played it like a soccer game for old people.<br>
JM: Really?<br>
TM: We didn’t really exercise. My strength level is very low. I ran for 10 min and rested for 5 min. I felt…tired.<br>
JM: Were there a lot of people?<br>
TM: So, for this group of friends<br>
we just started discussing (about playing together).<br>
Usually, there should be extra players to swap out right?<br>
But we only had players to make 2 teams.<br>
Everyone had to keep playing and that’s why we were so tired.<br>
JM: I see. It is good that you went to exercise Go run.<br>
You already ran a lot, didn’t you?<br>
TM: <em>laugh</em><br>
<em>(Note: Here, TM may have laughed because he was anticipating and wondering what joke JM is about to use next.)</em><br>
JM: I won’t joke anymore.<br>
NO MORE.<br>
<em>(Why not?)</em></p>
