<p>MC: Hello</p>
<p><tj>JMTM: Hello Hello..</tj></p>
<p>MC: Making merits</p>
<p><t>TM: Yes</t></p>
<p>Mc: You making merits together (paired merits), right?</p>
<p><t>TM: Ahh (yes), so that in the next life we can be...</t></p>
<p>MC: together</p>
<p><tj>JMTM: <em>laugh</em></tj></p>
<blockquote>
<p>MC: How was the atmosphere of today‚Äôs event?<br>
Were there a lot of fans who came to support you like in the previous event?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><t>TM: Actually, there are a lot of people. To be honest, we are still not used to being at an event and today, we did not expect/hope for lots of fans to be here.</t></p>
<p><j>JM: But look at the atmosphere here. Surrounding us...so many people.</j></p>
<p><t>TM: That‚Äôs right. Very busy.</t></p>
<p>MC: Is it around 10,000 people here?</p>
<p>JMTM: <em>laugh</em></p>
<p>MC: So, today, you also brought the T-shirts with you.</p>
<p><t>TM: That‚Äôs right. Today, we brought T-shirts to donate and for fans to join in on the auction. The money will go towards the Chaipattana Foundation.</t></p>
<p>MC: Did you actually wear the T- shirts?</p>
<p><t>TM: Yes, | did. | wore it just now.<br>
<em>laugh</em> No, | made that T-shirt specifically for donation, for the fans.</t></p>
<p>MC: How much money did you raised for making the merit?</p>
<p><j>JM: For me, 19K</j></p>
<p><t>TM: Actually, if you combine P‚ÄôZee‚Äôs, JM‚Äôs and my portions, it comes to approximately 60+K </t></p>
<p>MC: What about if just the two of you? Calculate, calculate.</p>
<p><t>TM: How much was mine? 20K...21K?</t></p>
<p><j>JM: 50K...no! Almost 40K</j></p>
<p><t>TM: For the two of us. 40K.</t></p>
<p><j>JM: Approximately 40K</j></p>
<p><tj>TM: 40K ‚Äî 41K<br>
JM: 40+K<br>
TM: Yes<br>
JM: Is it?</tj></p>
<p>MC: Is it?</p>
<p><t>TM: Yes, yes, yes.</t><br>
<j>JM: Yes, yes. That‚Äôs correct. | was just teasing him.</j><br>
<t>TM: Don‚Äôt make me confuse.</t><br>
<j>JM: He always gets flustered.</j></p>
<p>MC: So, you will get to be together for how long....40K lives.</p>
<p><t>TM: Oh, 40K lives. 1 Baht per 10K (TM said it wrong)...It is 1 Baht per life!</t></p>
<p><j>JM: | think. | think we are talking to the wrong person. <em>laugh</em></j></p>
<p>MC: Is it? Do we meet each other too often?</p>
<p><t>TM: That‚Äôs right. Whenever | see you, you always ‚Äòchong‚Äô (say things to pair them together as couple) us so hard.<br>
TM: | will remove your ‚Äònews reporter‚Äô name tag and exchange it for ‚Äòbarista‚Äô name tag<br>
<em>(Because baristas ‚Äòchong‚Äô mix drinks - play of words with same sound)</em> </t></p>
<p><j>JM: He is a ‚Äòchong-er‚Äô</j></p>
<p>Mc: Oh, I am a shipper?</p>
<p><t>TM: You still don‚Äôt know that?</t></p>
<blockquote>
<p>MC: Alright. So, just now we spoke about the T-shirt that you brought.<br>
Now, let‚Äôs talk a little about your personal stories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><t>TM: Yes, OK.</t></p>
<p>MC: Tell us about something that you most possessive of, most loved or liked</p>
<p><t>TM: For me, the thing that | am most possessive of...<br>
So, when | was young, the group of friends that | am with changes each year, right?<br>
And there is this one box, it is a box used to store gifts.<br>
Gifts that | received for my birthdays or gifts that friends gave me e.g. friendship diaries.<br>
| will keep those things in that box.<br>
Also, my friends‚Äô shirts that has writings on them. Something like that.</t></p>
<p>MIC: You still keep those things?</p>
<p><t>TM: Yes, I do. It is getting old. My grandma wants to clean the place up, but | wouldn‚Äôt let her touch my things.<br>
That‚Äôs because | was afraid that | wouldn‚Äôt be able to locate those things later.<br>
They are things that...When | visit home...when | feel tired, | would open that box and reminisce old memories that are still there.</t></p>
<p>MC: Are you very possessive of those things?</p>
<p><t>TM: Very much. They are physical representations of my memories.<br>
Sometimes, | already forgot some of those memories. Once | go back and look at those things, they remind me of the good old times.</t></p>
<p>MC: Are you possessive of it less than you are possessive of JM?</p>
<p><tj>JMTM: <em>make strange noises at each other</em></tj></p>
<p><j>JM: | told you this reporter is extra- ordinary!</j></p>
<p>MC: What about you? Do you have something that you are possessive of?</p>
<p><j>JM: For me, that would be toys.<br>
These toys were accumulated (collected) since my older brothers‚Äô generations.<br>
My brothers are approximately 8 years older than | am.<br>
The oldest is the same age as P‚Äô Zee. Yes, the age is around P‚ÄôZee‚Äôs.<br>
These things are toys from their generation. Cards and toy figures. The good ones are the limited- edition figures from fast food shops.<br>
These can no longer be purchased. They are stored in boxes. And | was a kid who grew up after my older brothers.<br>
| had to play with what they played with.<br>
And, it is my childhood memory of not having anyone to play with because of the big age gap between my brothers and I.<br>
So, | needed to play with the action figures alone.</j></p>
<p>MC: | think you now have a friend to play with already.</p>
<p><t>TM: <em>Ah gung ging gung ging</em> <em>funny noises for children</em></t></p>
<p><t>TM: Was that good?</t></p>
<p><j>JM: | think it was good. <em>LOL</em></j></p>
<p>MC: So, you just played with the figures?</p>
<p><j>JM: That‚Äôs right. That is one of the things that | am very possessive of.</j></p>
<p>MC: What about the guitar? | heard that you are also possessive of the guitar.</p>
<p><j>JM: For guitars, | do not accumulate/collect those.<br>
There is a guitar that my dad gave me to practice on when | was in high school.<br>
When | moved to Bangkok for further study, | asked my dad if | could bring it along and he let me.<br>
It is my dad‚Äôs guitar. It is an old guitar. No one can touch it.<br>
It has to be well taken care of.</j></p>
<p><t>TM: Its age...probably it could be your P‚Äô (older than you), right?</t></p>
<p><j>JM: It is my P‚Äô, yeah, it probably is my P‚Äô, even (older than me, even). </j></p>
<p><t>TM: Ah, it can be JM‚Äôs P‚Äô.</t></p>
<p><j>JM: Yes, it has been around for a long time.</j></p>
<p>Mc: Did TM had a chance to play it yet?</p>
<p><t>TM: Yes, | play it all the time.</t></p>
<p><j>JM: Yes, he did already.</j></p>
<p>MC: Play what?</p>
<p><t>TM: Play guitar.</t></p>
<p><tj>JMTM: <em>laugh</em></tj></p>
<p><t>TM: | was going to say that the guitar sounds very good.<br>
The one that JM brought...It now became JM‚Äôs personal guitar.<br>
When we go on an outing or go as a team with other DMD boys for work, JM will bring it and we will play together, as a team.<br>
The guitar sounds very good.</t></p>
<p>MC: Was it good?</p>
<p><t>TM: You mean the sound?</t></p>
<p>MC: No, | mean can he play well?</p>
<p><tj>JMTM: <em>look at each other and giggle</em></tj></p>
<p><t>TM: Wait, what...l am getting paranoid, seriously.<br>
One minute, the one on the right teases me, then one minute the one on the left teases me.</t></p>
<p><j>JM: It‚Äôs like you are being surrounded.</j></p>
<blockquote>
<p>MC: Can you ask? Between you and the guitar, which is he more possessive?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><t>TM: Ah, between the guitar and I, which one are you more possessive?<br>
TM: Can you answer that?</t></p>
<p><j>JM: Of course, an object remains merely an object.<br>
You cannot replace a person; you cannot compare an object to a person.<br>
**I am more possessive of you, P‚Äô. **</j></p>
<p><t>TM: Ah! Keep this (clip) everyone! Moment! Good stuff!</t></p>
<p>MC: What about you? What about your guitar?</p>
<p><t>TM: As for my guitar, when | was young and just started practicing the guitar..<br>
My very first guitar was an electric guitar.</t></p>
<p><j>JM: Ah, you are rich, aren‚Äôt you? </j></p>
<p>MC: That is so advanced.</p>
<p><t>TM: <em>concentration temporarily lost because he was interrupted</em><br>
TM: Yes, erm...</t></p>
<p>MC: The whole package. Handsome and rich.</p>
<p><t>TM: What? Yes..ah <em>laugh</em></t></p>
<p><tj>JMTM: <em>laugh</em></tj></p>
<p><t>TM: At the time...<em>laugh</em> | am trying to concentrate and decide which story | should tell.</t></p>
<p><t>TM: So, | started forming a band, when | was young. Initially, | played the guitar that belonged to my P‚Äô (could be an older brother or sister ‚Äî unspecified).<br>
Then, once | have a band, | told my dad and granddad about it.<br>
They then gave mea budget and took me to buy a guitar.<br>
It was a second-hand one. We bought guitar, bass and speaker...| got a Paramount guitar.</t></p>
<p>MC: And you started playing.</p>
<p><t>TM: Yes, and | still keep that guitar until today. It is a black guitar. |am very possessive of it. | never take it anywhere.</t></p>
<p>MC: This is another thing that both of you like (that both of you have the same preference).</p>
<p><tj>JMTM: That‚Äôs right. <em>smile</em></tj></p>
<p>Mc: Alright, tell fans about this event.</p>
<p><t>TM: For those of you who wants to donate money to the Chaipattana Foundation and other foundations, currently, the Central Embassy is open to receive donations.<br>
The money will be used to help those in need.</t></p>
<p><j>JM: That‚Äôs right. Be sympathetic towards each other.<br>
Say, if you want to go buy food. Once you bought the food, you may hold off on buying the drinks and use that money for donation instead.<br>
Then you go outside and get a free drink.</j></p>
<p><t>TM: LOL,/t&gt;<br>
<j>JM: Ah, what about that idea!</j></p>
<p><t>TM: Is that OK? LOL</t></p>
<p><j>JM: So that we will have money to make merit.</j></p>
<p><t>TM: It is a small kindness. If we have a little, we give a little. Something like that.</t></p>
<p><j>JM: If you have a lot...you give a little or a lot, it doesn‚Äôt matter. It still counts as ‚Äògiving‚Äô.</j></p>
<p>MC: Have the two of your asked each other to go make merits together?</p>
<p><tj>JMTM: Asked each other to go make merits together?</tj></p>
<p><t>TM: Here, we are doing it right here. We are doing it right here. </t></p>
<p><j>JM: Right here, at the place where we are giving this interview.</j></p>
<p>MC: Will you give in secret?</p>
<p><t>TM: | would in a minute (do in secret).<br>
If | tell you, then you would know about it. If | tell you, then it won't be a secret giving.</t></p>
<p><j>JM: Actually, if talking about making merits, it would be when we go with DMD more.</j></p>
<p><t>TM: Yes, we will go as a team more. </t></p>
<p>MC: Alright, thank you.</p>
<p><tj>JMTM: Thank you.</tj></p>
<p>MC: At an event too often...</p>
