<ul>
<li>I was riding my bike, and I fell oon my arm, it's hurting really bad.</li>
<li>I went to urgent care, and they did an X-Ray and wrapped my arm up, but they said I needed to come here cuz how the break looked on the X-ray.</li>
<li>They gave me some meds for pain.</li>
<li>I did have a cough.</li>
<li>It must have been a month or so ago.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="joint-pain">Joint Pain</h1>
<ul>
<li>Hello Dr.J. Since I had my indentical twins （同卵雙胞胎）, I feel weaker by the day. (白天)</li>
<li>I used to be stronger, but now I feel as if my strength is deteriorating. (惡化)</li>
<li>My knee hurts the most.</li>
<li>After sitting for a long time, I have difficulty straightening my legs and I feel a sharp pain inside my kneew, in the center.</li>
<li>It does when I go on a long walk or if I go up and down a couple flights of stairs.</li>
<li>Sometimes my right knee locks動不了 and I think I hear a grinding noise摩擦 when I move it, It's very painful.</li>
<li>None that I am aware of.</li>
<li>My fingers hurts and they feel numb, but that because I have a carple tunnel syndrome.腕管綜合症</li>
<li>The orthopedist that I used to see before my insurance changed had m e use a support brace for my right wrist.</li>
<li>Mostly some over-counter painkillers, Resting does help, but with the twins, good luck with that.</li>
<li>你的膝蓋有軟骨軟化症：chondromalacia of patella.</li>
<li>Is the pt covered by my insurance?</li>

<li>骨質疏鬆 osteoporosis 更加傾向於 more prone to</li>
<li>I feel okay now, my hip burns a little but I'm mostly comfortable.</li>
<li>I need to go home, I need to take care of my grandchildren after school.</li>
<li>Pneumonia and blood clots 肺炎同血塊</li>
<li>Can you explain to my daughter what the surgery will be like?</li>
<li>Do I really need to have this surgery? I heard hospitals sometimes ddo unnessary surgeries lioke cesarean sections.</li>
<li>But having screws in my hip sounds painful, what happens after the surgery? How long will need to be here?</li>
<li>氏導尿管（氣囊導尿管）： Foley Catheter, to drain urine（導出尿液）</li>
<li>Yes I hear ppl feel sicker when they are in the hospital. When can I get up for the surgery?</li>
<li>I just don't know how they can satrt moving me so much and have me exercing after cutting me open and putting screws in my hips. what if the screews get loose?</li>

<h1 id="elbow-fracture">Elbow Fracture</h1>
<ul>
<li>I was in the kitchen when I heard a loud noise in the living room. I went running in to see if my son was ok and heard him crying.</li>
<li>He would't stop crying.</li>
<li>All he siad was that his arm was hurting and he couldn't get up on his own.</li>
<li>I grabbeed him by the arm but that made hikm scream so much that ut scared me. I called my husband to come help me because I have back problems.</li>
<li>He missed and ended up hitting his elbow on the wood floor. I didn't think it was too bad so I put some ice on it.</li>
<li>Then It got very puffy and swollen and he had more trouble moving his arm. He seemed very weak so we call 911.</li>
<li>what happens if it's broken?</li>
<li>Is that same thing as cast?</li>
<li>Is he going to be able to play baseball?</li>

<h1 id="visting-the-occupational-therapy">Visting the Occupational Therapy</h1>
<ul>
<li>I have gotten up a couple of times.</li>
<li>I tried with crutches, but sometimes the walker just easier.</li>
<li>I do need some help with my socks and pants.</li>
<li>That looks pretty complicated.</li>
<li>Sure, but I am not sure how to get back to bed if my leg hurts too much.</li>
<li>I think those extenders(擴展器) will really help me with putting my pants on too.</li>
<li>I guess. I have been in some pain, but the nurse just gave me some meds for it.</li>
<li>Yeah, my uncle was telling me that happened to him when he had crutches last year, so he said it's probably better to use the walker.</li>
