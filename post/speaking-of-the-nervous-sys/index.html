<li>My right arm, It still feels numb. What was that test you mentioned?</li>
<li>I think I have heard of that before.</li>
<li>I told him not to bring me since I was beginning to feel better. I don't want to spend 6 hours here. I want to go home.</li>
<li>My brother, I think. I don't know if that is what he had. He is in a wheelchair now and he can't move anything on his right side.</li>
<li>What can I do right now? I don't want to end up like my borther. He is a completely different person now.</li>

<li>No, Since my recent accident I only take what the doctor gives me.</li>
<li>Some days it's terrible. But i have to do what I can to not be a burden on my family.</li>
<li>It depends. Sometimes I go and because of the pain I am irritable or I get frustrated and snap at my family.</li>
<li>Some days better than others, but It's always there.</li>
<li>Sometimes throds. and Sometimes I feel tingling and numberness in my back and leg,. And I have a lot of stiffness and muscle spasms.</li>
