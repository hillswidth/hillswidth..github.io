<p><p2>JM: The great swordsman, Musashiiii (teasing TM's hair)</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Look at him tease me.<br>
I'm already shy, you...</p1><br>
<p1>TM: Hello, I am Tommy Sittichok.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Hello, I am Jimmy.</p2><br>
<p1>TM: We didn't discuss beforehand (about matching tops)</p1><br>
<p2>JM: No, we didn't. Actually, I didn't even know that there will be an interview today. Yes.<p2></p>
<p><p2>JM: Actually, a fan gave me this top so I wore it. What about you?</p2><br>
<p1>TM: I bought this.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Is it your favourite T-shirt?</p2><br>
<p1>TM: No, no. Favourite would imply that I wear it a lot. I'm not sure where I got this top from.</p1></p>
<p><p1>TM: How ready are you?</p1><br>
<p2>JM: How ready are you?</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Honestly speaking...</p1><br>
*JM: <em>hand on TM shoulder</em><br>
<p1>TM: In terms of our own show, I am very ready but for the show that we do with everyone, this is the first time we all practice together. </p1><br>
MC: So how was it?<br>
<p1>TM: Ermm... Just like what you saw. Go back to see the clips. </p1><br>
<p2>JM: That's right.</p2><br>
<p1>TM: We danced out of tune sometimes because we are not adept at dancing.<br>
TM: In terms of our own show,<br>
I am very ready but for the show that we do with everyone<br>
this is the first time we all practice together.<br>
TM: But I can guarantee that the real show will outcome perfect. </p1><br>
<p2>JM: We are going to practice by ourselves after being ‘the kids at the back of the class’.<br>
Just now we were standing right here. </p2></p>
<p><p2>Where were you just now? </p2><br>
<p1>TM: I went to tie my hair.<br>
My head was wet. I can’t deal. My head was so wet from dancing. </p1><br>
<p2>JM: Right, you had trouble with the sweat.</p2><br>
<p1>TM: That’s right. </p1></p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="how-is-your-couples-show-better-than-other-couples-show">How is your couple’s show better than other couples’ show?</h2>
</blockquote>
<p><p1>TM: I think it’s not about being better.<br>
Each show is special in its own way.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: That’s right. I feel like they are of different styles.</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Each will draw out the character of each couple in the best way possible.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: That’s right.<br>
But I feel like for ours, the character has changed. From young musicians... </p2><br>
<p1>TM: From two young boys playing guitar </p1><br>
<p2>JM: Suddenly, it became ‘JimmyTommy the musical’</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Ahhh, you want to know right? What’s ‘the musical’ is like?</p1><br>
<p2>JM: I won’t tell you that just yet.</p2></p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="both-of-you-are-originally-good-at-singing-and-dancing">Both of you are originally good at singing and dancing…?</h2>
</blockquote>
<p><p1>TM: I can say that we are better at playing folk music a folk duet. But they came and like:</p1><em>show dance move</em><br>
<p2>JM: Very confused. Super confused.  </p2><br>
<p1>TM: There were extra dance moves and many specific cues added into the show.<br>
But, honestly, the first time I saw the show, I was quite surprised.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Yes</p2><br>
<p1>TM: It looks like a big production</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Yeah, it looks like a huge production…like…Eh!<br>
I better not say more.<br>
I almost let that one slip.<br>
Anyhow, what I can say is that the show breaks away from our usual characters.<br>
It is something that we are not used to doing. Everyone would be like, ‘Oh! These…two…’</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Two lightning buddies! </p1><br>
<p2>JM: Lightning buddies? LOL</p2><br>
<p1>TM: No x2</p1><br>
<p2>JM: No, like, why these two became like this? </p2><br>
<p1>TM: Yeah, something like that.<br>
Prepare tissue or something to wipe the saliva.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Saliva LOL</p2><br>
<p1>TM: You mouth hangs open <em>demonstrate</em></p1><br>
<p2>JM: Not to that point x2 In conclusion, you will definitely feel happy and fun</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Yes.</p2></p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="how-galaxy-will-it-be">How ‘galaxy’ will it be??</h2>
</blockquote>
<p><p1>TM：I think, we can take everyone to the star, this one. Really.</p1><br>
MC: Can you expand on that?<br>
<p2>JM: As mentioned, the ‘galaxy theme’ relates to the space.<br>
Our show would be themed similarly. Following the fan meet’s theme. </p2></p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="for-those-who-still-havent-gotten-the-tickets">For those who still haven’t gotten the tickets…</h2>
</blockquote>
<p><p1>TM: Why are you hesitating?</p1><br>
<p2>JM: I don’t see why you should hesitate. </p2><br>
<p1>TM: We have been waiting for you for so long, since the COVID period, so long.<br>
These will be special shows that we put a 100% effort<br>
into choosing and making.<br>
Why should you wait?<br>
If you miss us, Mii2 couple or ZeeSaint couple…</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Yes, if it was me I would buy it right away.<br>
I won’t wait. I would buy it right away. </p2><br>
<p1>TM: Yes, yes. To those who will wait to meet us at the event<br>
I can guarantee that I will do my best, to the best of our abilities.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Yes, we will combine our forces, like ‘Chakras’.<br>
As soon as we touch each other,<br>
it will be ‘Gotenks’ right away </p2><br>
<p1>TM: That’s fusion, fusion.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Oh, fusion, right?<br>
We will do that ‘fusion’ and do our best.<p2/><br>
<p1>TM: I guarantee that it will be worth it. See you there!  </p1></p>

<h1 id="0826-on-aired-zoom-dara-section">0826 on Aired Zoom Dara Section</h1>
<p><p1>TM: Actually, today is the first day of the whole-cast rehearsal.<br>
It was quite difficult because we have almost no skill in dancing.</p1><br>
MC: None at all?<br>
<p1>TM: None. We can say no skill at all. </p1><br>
<p2>JM: That’s right.</p2></p>
<p><p1>TM: What’s more difficult is that<br>
there used to be old dance moves and that confused us.<br>
We have danced this song before but then they added new moves in. That confused us a little. </p1><br>
<p2>JM: That’s right.<br>
Actually, I wanted to say that the reason why they added more moves in is so that the dance looks more special. </p2><br>
<p1>TM: Yeah, looks stronger. Looks more professional.  </p1><br>
<p2>JM: Yes, and if you are good at dancing and you follow that choreography, you will look cool immediately.<br>
But if it was us dancing…ah…..</p2><br>
<em>sweat</em><br>
<p2>At the beginning when we walked in and the instructor said that today the dance will be similar to the previous version but then..<br>
That ‘BUT’ </p2><br>
<em>lol</em><br>
<p2>BUT there will be small changes. O-ho….</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Honestly, the image that I saw when I looked into the mirror…<br>
In my head, that ‘BUT’… I was like... </p1><br>
<em>back of hand to forehead</em><br>
<p1>But honestly, today is just the first day of the practice.<br>
By the time of the real show,<br>
we would already be ready and the show should come out well. </p1><br>
<p2>JM: Yeah, it is definitely separated to make the show perfect…</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Secretly, I was a little shocked/surprised. At the beginning, I thought that it would definitely be quiet.<br>
But recently, we just went to an event for the first (in a long time)<br>
and I was very surprised. The amount of fans was overwhelming. </p1><br>
<p2>JM: Yes.</p2><br>
<p1>TM: I was shocked. </p1><br>
<p2>JM: Previously, when we had events, before our ‘ending scene’,<br>
there would be a certain amount of fans attending our events.<br>
But at the event 2-3 days ago, there were so many people.<br>
We have never seen this many people before.<br>
Normally, we already feel alright with this sorts of events.</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Yes</p1><br>
<p2>JM: We are not too nervous/excited anymore.<br>
But this time, when we walked onto the stage and the crowd filled the space.<br>
We felt nervous/excited all over again,<br>
as if we have never been to an event before.</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Actually… How do you say this?<br>
JM and I always chat.<br>
We will send funny memes and songs to each other all the time.<br>
That’s because JM listens to similar types of songs as I do;<br>
the non-mainstream songs.  Songs that doesn’t follow the popular trend. We are of similar type.</p1><br>
MC: You have similar lifestyle.<br>
<p2>JM: During the COVID period,<br>
there would be jobs e.g. news reporters will call us for interviews. So, we need to keep in contact during those times too.</p2><br>
<p1>TM: I have belly, these days. During the COVID period, who doesn’t have bigger belly?<br>
For me, everything tasted good. during the time when there isn’t much else to do.<br>
JM, you understand me, right? </p1><br>
<p2>JM: Ahh (yes). </p2><br>
<p1>TM: It is the time that we get to spend with ourselves and with our family. Eat yummy things; have a nice time together.<br>
But after that, I started playing soccer.<br>
Started to not be able to only love myself.  My weight increased. Yes, it did. </p1><br>
MC: How many kilograms?<br>
<p1>TM: From 57, now I am 60-61 kg. </p1><br>
MC: That’s so little.<br>
<p1>TM: But I can feel it. I mean, I can feel myself.<br>
I began to feel uncomfortable.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Yes, you are always with yourself, every day.</p2><br>
MC: What about you?<br>
<p2>JM: For me, during the COVID period,<br>
I played guitar and played game with friends,  because I can’t go anywhere.<br>
I talked with my dogs. Played and talked with my dogs.  </p2><br>
MC: And you two are always in contact.<br>
<p2>JM: Yes, always. We worked on figuring out chords for new songs. Played game together.<br>
Just doing random things because we had to stay home every day.</p2></p>

<p>MC: They said that you two are boyfriends. I want to know about that.</p>
<p><p2>JM: Ah, they said we are boyfriends right?<br>
They said we are a 'real couple'.</p2><br>
MC: They said you are a 'real couple' not an 'imagined couple'<br>
<p2>JM: Oh...like this</p2><br>
MC: Clear the news/doubts now<br>
<p2>JM: I clear it now.<br>
I will say it right here.<br>
ก็ผมมีที่ทอมมี่ครับ<br>

<p1>TM: <em>stares at JM</em></p1><br>
MC: That's all? x2<br>

Ah...เอาจริงๆ ผมก็มีแค่จิมมี่ เอาจริงๆ<br>
Honestly, I only have JM, honestly<br>
TM: 'พี่'ทอมมี่ เวลาทำงานก็มีกันแค่สองคนแหละ<br>
These days, when we work, there's only the two of us.</p1><br>
MC: Everything becomes air?<br>
<p1>TM: What was that? </p1><br>
<p2>JM: No, everyone is still within our sight.</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Ahh (yes)...<em>nod</em></p1><br>
<p2>JM: May be...may be...</p2><br>
<p1>TM: It's just that we 'sync' with each other more than with others.<br>
That's all.</p1><br>
<p2>JM:<br>
<em>hand to chest</em><br>
You said it like that.</p2><br>
<p1>TM: <em>poke MC</em><br>
I'm shy.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: That's that.<br>
Anyhow, thank you everyone for your interest in our couple.</p2><br>
MC: Are you single?<br>
<p1>TM: I am single. </p1><br>
MC: He's single. If he's going to...<br>
<em>moving microphone back and forth between JMTM</em><br>
<p2>JM: <em>laugh</em></p2><br>
<p1>TM: I speak honestly here, now a days, it is very open</p1><br>
MC: There is nothing wrong if the two of you like each other, correct?<br>
<p1>TM: That's right. That is something for the future.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: That's right. Future. There is nothing wrong.</p2><br>
<p1>TM: If we really 'like' then just let the feelings be.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Yes.</p2><br>
<p1>TM: If it is THAT CLEAR then I will let it be.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: I probably cannot stop myself from liking someone.<br>
We probably need to wait and see the future. </p2><br>
MC: Do you like?<br>
<p2>JM: Ah..  <em>eyes meet TM's eyes</em>   like krub.<br>
I like. No, I feel comfortable.</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Oh, you (the MC) 'chong' (say) like that, I am shy, do you know that?</p1><br>
<p2>JM: I feel comfortable when...like this..</p2><br>
MC: When you look into each others' eyes, you feel comfortable<br>
<p2>JM: Actually, it is the most comfortable.<br>
I have never been able to look into someone's eyes for...</p2><br>
<p1>TM: For as long as this.</p1></p>
<p>MC: (asked something) <em>laugh</em><br>
<p2>JM: Yes. And there will be someone speaking into the microphone in the back of the monitor.<br>
'Closer closer closer'. P'! our noses are almost touching!</p2></p>
<p><p1>TM: Actually, there will definitely be (something) but I want to keep that a secret first.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: There will definitely be (something)</p2></p>
<p>JMTM: Ah, and that is SaifahZon Story.<br>
JMTM: That’s right.</p>
<p>MC: We shall wait and follow that. Talk about the fan meet<br>
<p1>TM: We want to leave the fan meet of Why R U the series in your care. We have kept it in (unable to organise one)<br>
for a long time and everyone gave their 100% in this show.<br>
There will be lots of surprises.<br>
Just the theme is already surprising, right?</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Yes</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Only the shows that we know about, we are already surprised/shocked.<br>
Why wouldn’t the fans feel that way too when they see it? </p1><br>
<p2>JM: How do you do ‘shock’?</p2><br>
JMTM: <em>acts shock</em><br>
MC: Don’t you need to hug each other when you are shocked/scared?<br>
<p2>JM: Erm…sometimes, our hands can’t go that far</p2><br>
<p1>TM: I can FEEL that he (the MC) is a shipper!</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Could it be that you are...</p2><br>
MC: I am not a shipper. I am a news reporter.<br>
