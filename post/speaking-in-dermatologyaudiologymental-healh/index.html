<li>I turn them off.</li>
<li>Because they bother me. I can't stand them in my ears. Have you ever had something stuck in your ear, Doctor?</li>
<li>They bother me all the time. I just turn them off. I want to return them.</li>
<li>They hurt my ear and they make everything so loud. I have headches now.  I didn't have headches before.</li>
<li>I'd rather not hear anyone. I want to give them back.</li>
<li>I don't know how I can feel comfortable with these things. I get so many headches now.</li>
<li>It's too lound. I am not used to this. it is friving me crazy.</li>
<li>So, I can't turn them off when I want to?</li>
<li>I'd rather not wearing them at all.</li>

<li>The police brought me.</li>
<li>I was walking aone near my home and they stopped me. But I don't reeber walking there.</li>
<li>I came home from work late last night. I ate dinner and I fell asleep, I was very tired.</li>
<li>This happe3ned to me when I was a child. My mother would have to lock the door t oour house with special locks so that I wouldn't get out.</li>
<li>Tonight is the first night it is happened since I was really little.</li>
<li>Well a few months ago I couldn't sleep at all. The doctor gave me some pills to take.</li>
<li>It was hard foe me t ofall asleep and I would wake up a lot at night.</li>
<li>No, I did break my arm once.</li>
<li>That is right.</li>
<li>I live alone; my family has passed on.</li>
<li>My wife and my daughter, in the earthquake.</li>
<li>I still dream about that day a lot.  I wake up sweating.</li>
<li>Sometimes I 'll be at work and everything will be fine, and then suddenly it's like I am back there all over again.</li>
<li>I see my wife and Mina on that day. I see all the ppl running, telling, screaming. I try to hard to forget, but I know I will never forget.</li>
<li>Honestly recently that's all I think about. I wish I had died too.</li>
<li>I wanted to keep on sleeping, but I woke up right away.</li>
