<p2>JM: …would always call me, ‘Mii’. </p2><br>
<p1>TM: ‘Mii’</p1><br>
<p2>JM: ‘Mii’<br>
JM: ‘Jimmy’ right? But no one else has the ending sound of their names as…</p2><br>
<p1>TM: call ‘Jim’…</p1><br>
<p2>JM: …‘Mii’ apart from me, in my class. They just call me ‘Mii’ ‘Mii! Ai Mii!’. This word. Until today when I play game with my friends, I still use the name ‘Mii’. It became habitual to use that word.</p2><br>
<p1>TM: For me, like I said. There are two types of friends, ones that call me ‘Tom’ and ones that calls me ‘Mii’. And the majority will call me ‘Mii’.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Mii, right?</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Only friends who are very close, who always hang out together with me, would call ‘Tom’. But actually, they are both OK. The two are names that both relates to my name. </p1><br>
<p2>JM: It is ‘Mii’</p2><br>
<p1>TM: It’s JimmyTommy. ‘Mii’ is the only common denominator</p1><br>
<p2>JM: It’s like when you learn algebra and you have to expand the word ‘Mii2’. Each goes into a bracket; 'Mii' and Mii'. Becomes 'Mii-Mii'</p2><br>
<p1>TM: That works. 'Mii-Mii'.</p1></p>

<p1>TM: That day, I was very confused/surprised. Actually, I wanted to say that, when I first joined DMD;<br>
I was the only one who listens to ‘Indie’ and ‘Underground’ music, and songs that aren’t ‘mass’<br>
*(i.e. isn’t ‘mainstream’; same sense of the word ‘mass’ in ‘mass communication’). *The songs that are ‘mass’, everyone would listen to, right?<br><br>
And when I play my music, everyone would be confused and would wonder what song it is.<br>
It has always been my understanding that I listen to strange songs compared to others. <br><br>
Therefore, I didn’t dare to let others listen to my music.<br>
When I listen, I would listen alone. Until that day when JM came.<br>
JM was confused/surprised. Then he said, O! P’, you listen to this song as well? And then…</p1><br><br>
<p2>JM: <em>picks up a tiny black wire (?)</em> P’ Aof, why did you throw this here? Those of you who are confused/who wonders why P’ Aof threw this at us, please leave the comments asking this question. . </p2><br>
JMTM: <em>laugh</em><br>
<p1>TM: JM then said that he also listens to that song. Then I thought, ‘that’s cool’<br>
It is like the first time that…O ho! (surprised sound).<br><br>
The first time that someone says that they listen to this type of music;<br>
the style of which I have always been rejected upon (by others).<br>
That day I thought, ‘I have found a friend’. </p1><br><br>
<p2>JM: <em>laugh</em> Yes, yes. That day, I was the same as you.<br>
I have been listening to these types of music, not knowing anything, all alone. </p2><br>
<p1>TM: Yes.</p1></p>

<p><p1>TM: Lyrics meaning. Lyrics meaning first, right away.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Why?</p2><br>
<p1>TM: I don't know. I feel that, songs that have a good meaning, when you listen, you won't get bored. Do you understand what I mean?<br>
It is 'staying with the meaning' (i.e. you remain liking it because of its meaning).<br>
Not like the melody that, after listening to many times, you will soon get bored.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Ahhhh, that time...that time...</p2><br>
<p1>TM: But if it is a song that has meaning, the song will stay with us for a long time. We can listen to it without getting bored. It has meaning.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: That time you used logic and brain. What about now?</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Now, I like both. Because, sometimes, I don't listen to the meaning.<br>
Just close my eyes and listen to the melody; liking that melody, when that melody starts, I already like it. There is no reason why</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Mmm <em>nod</em> So...</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Both (I like), now.</p1><br>
<p2>JM: The longer we do something...At first, we would use logic, then after that, we will use our hearts.</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Mmm... <em>turns to look at JM</em></p1><br>
JMTM: <em>eyes meet eyes</em> ...</p>
<p><p2>JM: ...<em>Slightly smiling face</em> Just saying (as in, said with no particular agenda intended)<p2><br>
JMTM: <em>giggle</em><br>
<p1>TM: If I am the clip editor, I would cut that part to highlight that eyes-meet-eyes 'spark' moment <em>LOL</em> Then cut to the later bit when JM says, 'Just saying (no agenda intended)'  <em>ngao</em> (a sound indicative of a joke)</p1></p>
<p><p2>JM: For me, it is the melody.<br>
This question is like the question of: 'What makes a sad song sad? Lyrics meaning or melody?'<br>
Actually, I think that songs have melody so that we listen to the melody.<br>
If a song doesn't have a melody then it is not a song. It becomes a poem.<br>
But songs can remain as a song on its own by its melody, correct? Therefore, I think that, in fact, for songs, you need to listen to the melody.</p2><br>
<p1>TM: And the answer is...</p1></p>
<p><p2>JM: In conclusion, answer, melody! </p2><br>
<p1>TM: Krub (yes)</p1><br>
<p2>JM: Oh, thank you so much for concluding for me. </p2><br>
JMTM: <em>laugh</em></p>

<p><p1>TM: ‘Mii-Mii’. This name. I tell you that I used to be a ‘manner kid’. Everyone may not know about this. </p1><br>
<p2>JM: What is that? </p2><br>
<p1>TM: ‘Manner kids’ are kids who have to go and practice their ‘wai’ skills after the morning assembly.<br>
Practice how to ‘wai’ (pay respect) adults, teachers or monks (a different ‘wai’ for each situation).<br>
<em>[Note: ไหว้ ‘wai’ = the way Thai people pay respect, say hello/sorry/thank you; it involves bringing together one’s hands in front of one’s chest/head]</em> </p1><br>
<p2>JM: Really? Oh!</p2><br>
<p1>TM: Yeah, (practice) ways to ‘wai’.<br>
TM: And the P’s (older persons) who teach us are girls, right? They would call me, ‘Mii-Mii’. They would say ‘Mii-Mii’ and do this <em>does cute hand gesture next to own head</em></p1><br>
<p2>JM: ‘Mii-Mii’ and then like this? <em>copies TM’s hand gesture</em><br>
JM: This means that you must look very cute when you were young.  </p2><br>
<p1>TM: If we are talking about when I was young. Young like…around middle school period. </p1><br>
<p2>JM: I see. And now, he became handsome and manly instead. Yeahhhh</p2></p>
